# Fraudulent-Transaction-Analysis-and-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
In this project we will do analysis on transactions of a payment company to detect the fraud using ML models. Let's say a company named as IPAYU has been providing it's financial services to the variety of users in a country. But at the same time there are loopholes in security measures (in the meanwhile company is upgrading it's security). Fraudster might try to crack inside the company's interface and can commit fraudulent transactions. It may harm people trust towards the company. To tackle this situation of crisis, they have consulted a team of data scientists.  Now the question is how this problem could be solved using data science? While there are many ways to prevent the fraud and loss occur. Let's walk through a simple pave how this team handled problem of fraudulent transaction to identify and automated model for future transactions.
